You've decoded the secret.
You're entitled to a reward.
But what if the reward is total demolition of the fourth wall?
Welcome to the echo chamber.

The ending you read was not the one I originally wrote.
The original was bleaker — less closure, more collapse.
Think of it as a blooper reel, if bloopers could fracture reality.


She went to the restroom to freshen up when a voice spoke.<br>
“Did you enjoy the life I gave you?” it asked.
Sarah saw a human silhouette standing in behind her with no discerning features, as if in full vantablack body paint. A chill went down her spine, but she asked, “Who are you?”
“No need to be afraid, Sarah. You can call me Ms. Rosenberg,” the voice replied, a familiar cadence in her tone.
“What do you mean, the life you gave me?” asked Sarah.
Ms. Rosenberg laughed. “Before I answer that question, I would like you to meet someone.” A woman, identical to Sarah, emerged from a stall.
“Hello. I’m the narrator version of you, Sarah,” the woman said.
“Narrator? What do you mean, narrator?” asked Sarah, baffled.
“Do you remember what Clay Kaczmarek said to Desmond in Assassin's Creed Revelations, right before the Animus island was about to be deleted, Sarah? ‘What is a man, but the sum of his memories? We are the stories we live, the tales we tell ourselves,’” Narrator Sarah said, her voice a calm echo of Sarah’s own inner thoughts.
“I do, but I don't see the relevance here. What do you mean?” asked Sarah.
“I’ve been watching, telling your story, Sarah,” replied Narrator Sarah.
“So I’m supposed to believe none of this is real?” asked Sarah, existential dread in her eyes.
“For you, it’s as real as it gets. I only wish it were my reality. I tried to give you a near-perfect life, Sarah,” said Ms. Rosenberg.
“Ms. Rosenberg, I still don't understand.” said Sarah, her mind reeling.
“I am The Architect, Sarah. Your life will go on, but I am no longer needed to guide it.” said Ms. Rosenberg, and with that, they vanished as mysteriously as they had appeared, while Ms. Rosenberg’s voice faded into nothing, leaving Sarah’s reality unchanged as if nothing had happened.
